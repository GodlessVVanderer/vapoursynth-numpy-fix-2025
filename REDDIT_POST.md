# Finally got VapourSynth + SVP4 working on GTX 1650 Mobile!

After weeks of "NumPy version conflicts" and "Python compatibility" errors, I finally have a working setup for frame interpolation on my laptop.

## TL;DR - The Magic Combo:
- Python 3.12.8 (not 3.11!)
- NumPy 1.26.4 (NOT 2.0!)
- CUDA 11.8 (not 12)
- VapourSynth R72
- PotPlayer in VapourSynth mode

## Quick Install:
```bash
pip install numpy==1.26.4
pip install torch==2.7.0+cu118 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

## The Game Changer:
Everyone says "Python 3.12 doesn't work with VapourSynth" - **that's false!** It's actually NumPy 2.0 that breaks everything. Stay on NumPy 1.26.4 and Python 3.12 works perfectly.

## Performance on GTX 1650 Mobile:
- 1080p 60fps interpolation: ~40% GPU
- Anime to 144fps: ~60% GPU  
- 4K to 60fps: ~90% GPU (but it works!)

## Critical Settings:
In PotPlayer: **F5 → Video → VapourSynth** (NOT AviSynth!)

This laptop GPU handles frame interpolation just fine with the right setup. Don't let anyone tell you that you need an RTX card!

Edit: Running on Ryzen 7 4800HS + GTX 1650 Mobile laptop
